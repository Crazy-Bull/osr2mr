# osr2mr
An attempt to transform osu! mania replay files to malody replay files.

The transform is based on timestamps of key actions (press and release).
So the result screen doesn't show score, combo, accuracy nor numbers judgements.

GUI mode is under development, now the project only consists of key code.

Instructions of using this project will be appended after the GUI mode is committed.

Issues are welcomed
