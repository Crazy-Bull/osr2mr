# osr2mr
An attempt to transform osu! mania replay files to malody replay files.

The transformation is based on timestamps of key actions (press and release).
So the result screen doesn't show score, combo, accuracy nor numbers judgements.

The repository provides a command-line version of the project.



GUI mode is under development.
Issues are welcomed
